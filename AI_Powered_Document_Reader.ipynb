        "## Part 1: Document Conversion, OCR, and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "### Document Conversion:\n",
        "I used the pypdf library to convert PDF documents into text. The Document_Conversion function takes a PDF file path as input, extracts text from each page, and concatenates it into a single string. pypdf was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling PDF files without the need for additional dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### OCR Integration\n",
        "For OCR (Optical Character Recognition), I use the pdf2image library to convert PDF pages into images and pytesseract to extract text from these images. The OCR_Integration function converts each page of the PDF to an image, applies OCR using pytesseract, and combines the extracted text into a single string. pytesseract was chosen for its accuracy and wide language support, making it suitable for documents in various languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preprocessing\n",
        "The preprocess function performs several steps to clean and prepare the text for LLM processing:\n",
        "* Removing repeating lines to reduce redundancy.\n",
        "* Cleaning text by removing newlines, tabs, and non-ASCII characters.\n",
        "* Language detection using the langdetect library, which supports a wide range of languages.\n",
        "* Sentence segmentation and tokenization using spaCy, a powerful NLP library. * I prioritize web-based models (_core_web_sm) over news-based models (_core_news_sm) for better general-purpose text handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 2: LLM-Powered Understanding and Actions\n",
        "\n",
        "### LLM Integration\n",
        "I used a combination of pre-trained models for various tasks, leveraging the power of transfer learning. This approach allows me to benefit from models trained on large datasets without the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Information Extraction\n",
        "* Named Entity Recognition (NER): I used the flair library with the flair/ner-german-large model for robust NER. Although this model is German-specific, it was chosen for its high accuracy and can be easily replaced with language-specific models.\n",
        "* Relationship Extraction: Also using flair, I extract relationships between entities. The pre-trained relations classifier was chosen for its ability to identify semantic relationships.\n",
        "* Summarization: I use the bert-extractive-summarizer library, which leverages BERT for extractive summarization. This model was chosen for its ability to identify key sentences without the need for fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Document Classification\n",
        "For document classification, I used the SetFitModel from the setfit library, specifically the luis-cardoso-q/kotodama-multilingual-v3 model. This model is pre-trained to classify documents into categories like \"buying,\" \"invoice,\" \"refund,\" etc. The multilingual aspect makes it suitable for my diverse language requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Internal Translation\n",
        "I used the transformers library from Hugging Face for translation. The google/bert2bert_L-24_wmt_de_en model is used for German to English translation. This model was chosen for its high-quality translations and the ability to handle long texts (up to 4000 tokens). For other languages, similar models can be integrated.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 3: User Interaction via a Chatbot Interface\n",
        "\n",
        "### Chatbot UI\n",
        "I used streamlit to create a web-based chatbot interface. streamlit was chosen for its simplicity in creating interactive web apps with Python. The interface allows users to:\n",
        "* Upload PDF documents.\n",
        "* View document language, summary, and English translation (if applicable).\n",
        "* Ask questions about entities, relationships, summary, or document category.\n",
        "* Provide feedback on the chatbot's responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pipeline Integration\n",
        "The process_document function integrates all the pipeline components:\n",
        "* Convert PDF to text and apply OCR.\n",
        "* Clean and preprocess the text.\n",
        "* Translate if not in English.\n",
        "* Extract entities, relationships, and generate summary.\n",
        "* Classify the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chatbot then uses this processed information to answer user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Requirements\n",
        "Libraries and Frameworks\n",
        "\n",
        "* Document Processing: pypdf, pdf2image, pytesseract\n",
        "* NLP and Preprocessing: spacy, langdetect, flair\n",
        "* LLM and Information Extraction: bert-extractive-summarizer, setfit, transformers\n",
        "* Chatbot UI: streamlit"
